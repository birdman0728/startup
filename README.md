# Barkmark

[My Notes](notes.md)

An organized place for all of your common links to go to so you can open them up quickly and don't have to have keep an absurd ammount of tabs open. You can also organize them into groups for quick access. For example, if a student wanted to create a tree for each class they were in they could open the entire tree at once while leaving the other classes alone. They could have one button that would open all essential tabs, like gradescope, the syllabus and github all at once and then have the option to have addtional tabs saved for refrence if they don't want to open them. As well as a way to add tags to additonal tabs for easier searching.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been working on projects and kept a bunch of tabs open for said project? The more tabs you get the harder it is to keep track and even impossible to do if you have to use a different computer. With Barkmark, the tree link webapp, All you have to remember is your email and password and you have access to all your tabs organized into projects and ready to start up at a moments notice with the option to keep non-essential tabs on hand for easy refrence. Great to use if you have multiple projects going on at once or even if you're a student and want to organize all your links into tabs.
